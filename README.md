### Infinite Primes from scratch

This is a Lean 4 proof of the decidability of primality and the
infinitude of prime numbers using only Nat lemmas from core, the
propext axiom and elementary tactics up to 'simp only'.

Definitions of divisibility, primality, etc. are based on Nat
arithmetic operations and all decidability instances proved from
scratch.
